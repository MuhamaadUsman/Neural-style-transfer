# Neural-style-transfer
Neural style transfer is a technique that combines the content of one image with the style of another image to create a new image. This process is based on deep neural networks and aims to transfer the artistic style of one image onto the content of another.

In PyTorch, you can achieve neural style transfer by utilizing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (such as VGG) to extract features from both the content and style images. Then, an optimization process adjusts the content image iteratively to minimize the content difference with the content image while simultaneously matching the style statistics of the style image. This optimization process involves defining appropriate loss functions, including content loss and style loss, and updating the content image using gradient descent or other optimization techniques. Finally, the optimized content image represents the content of the original image with the artistic style of the style image.
